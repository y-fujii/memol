<h1>memol</h1>

<p>Memol is a music notation language focused on MIDI.  It is
well-structured, score friendly and easy to read, compared with another
one.</p>

<h2>1. Features</h2>

<h3>1.1. Core notation</h3>

<p>Memol specify the note duration <em>not by number but by dividing the
unit duration.</em></p>

<p>Core notation of Memol has only two structures: "(...)" and "[...]".
"[...]" represents group notes.  It divide its duration equally into child
notes.  "(...)" represents chord.  Its child notes are put at the same time.
These can be nested each other.</p>

<p>Here is a example coded in usual notation:</p>

<pre>
a4 b4 &lt; c4. d16 d16 c8. &gt; b16 a16 &lt; e0 g0 b8. f8 e4. b2 a2
</pre>

<p>coded in Memol:</p>

<pre>
{ [a B] [C. [D D]] | [c. b] [a E.] [F (e g b)^] / | b a }
{ a B 3C [D D] | [3c b] [a 3E] [F (e g b)^] / | b a }
</pre>

<p>As you can see, Memol looks much prettier.</p>

<h3>1.2. Relative octave</h3>

<p>Memol has a mechanism to avoid annoying octave changing such as
"c&lt;b&gt;c&lt;b". If you write a note in upper case, it has higher pitch
than previous one within a octave.  If in lower case, it has lower pitch
within a octave.</p>

<h3>1.3. Separation of chord, backing form, expression</h3>
	
<p>Memol aims to separate some musical structure such as chord, backing form,
expression (control change, gate time, etc..)</p>

<h3>1.4. Extend with general programming language</h3>
